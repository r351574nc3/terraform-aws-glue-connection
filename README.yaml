# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Glue module for creating a connection (used by a Glue Job) to a datasource.

# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-
  If you are building a glue workflow with glue jobs that need to connect to RDS, you will need to first create a glue-connection and refer to that connection in the glue-job. Please see examples.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  ```hcl
  provider "aws" {
    region = var.region
  }

  module "vpc" {
    source     = "cloudposse/vpc/aws"
    cidr_block = "172.16.0.0/16"

    context = module.this.context
  }

  module "glue_connection" {
    source = "cloudposse/glue-connection/aws"

    enabled = var.enabled

    connection_type    = var.connection_type
    database_instance  = var.database_instance
    database_name      = var.database_name
    jdbc_database_type = var.jdbc_database_type
    region             = var.region
    vpc_id             = module.vpc.outputs.vpc_id

    context = module.this.context
  }
  ```

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here is an example of using this module:
  - [`examples/complete`](hhttps://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-glue-connection/tree/main/examples/complete/) - complete example of using this module

# How to get started quickly
quickstart: |-
  To get started quickly, determine what database, VPC the database is in, database type, region, and the type of connection you want to use. For example, we can
  create a `JDBC` connection to a `postgres` database named `test` with instance name `test-postgres` in `us-east-2` on our `vpc-xxxxx`. Once we have this connection,
  it can be used by glue-jobs to access the database.
